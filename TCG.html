<h2 align="center">Welcome!</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="aligncenter">Origin story</h2>	
<p>As a kid of the 90s, I was part of the initial "Pocket Monsters" craze with the release of Pokemon Blue and Red video games, as well as the cartoon. Between the release of both of those came the Pokemon Trading Card Game that was published and released in late 1996. My best friend and I were already into the video games and decided to start playing the card game. But eventually I went to high school, and my interest faded, and then I joined the Army and left my life packed up.</p>
<h2 class="aligncenter">The long awaited sequel</h2>
<p>In the start of 2024, I was tranisitioned out of the Army and found myself a job that took up a lot less time in my day. But that left my unsatisfied and it was an income I didn't need, so I quit with the aspirations of going back to school and anticipation of another job that would move me back to Texas. And suddently I had A LOT more time on my hands.</p>
<p>My old friend kept talking about how excited he was to get this new Pokemon deck, and how he laments the fact he didn't take better care of his cards when he was younger--his prized card would potentially fetch over $10,000. And as most retirees do, a new hobby found me. So I began buying packs. I definitely blame <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisxnickel83?igsh=MWpvNGY2NHhpZDl1">ChrisXNickel83</a> for that.</p>
<p>My children eventually started joining me in opening cards, and I started teaching them the value in them and how to best take care of them. These are all things I'm re-learning as I didn't consider myself much of a "long term collector" the first time around, but realize these are investments for my kids.</p>

<h2 class="aligncenter">The spin off</h2>	  
<p>My son did enjoy opening these with us, but to be honest it was something my daughter took more joy in. So, I wanted to do something specifically with my son. As we were looking at Pokemon packs in the store, I noticed these decks with Disney characters on them. I didn't know much about them at the time, but eventually I asked him if he'd be interested in collecting those kinds of cards. Fast forward 5 months and we were five binders and several hundred dollars into Lorcana.</p>
<br>
<p>We are hobbyist collectors of Pokemon TCGs and the Disney Lorcana trading card decks. We take excellent care to ensure cards remain safely packaged upon removal from the packs. In the pages for each deck which we are actively trading, buying, or selling in, you will find a list of any surplus or deficit for the given set.</p>

<h3>About Pokemon TCG</h3>
<p>Based on the Pokemon franchise, Pokemon TCG (or PTCG) is a collectible card game developed by Creatures Inc.. Gameplay cards include Pokémon cards, energy cards, trainer cards, and stadium cards. Basic (unevolved) Pokémon can change into their evolved forms during the game by playing subsequent evolution cards (stage 1, stage 2) that are in the deck. Energy cards are used to power attacks, and trainer cards can be used for different effects on the game. Damage counters are stacked on top of cards in play to indicate damage dealt, and players may choose to put their Pokémon cards on a bench to switch to a different attacker. The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent's Pokemon cards and win each of your prizes first. </p>

<h3>About Disney Lorcana</h3>
<p>Created by the company Ravensburger, this game is story driven. With decks of at least 60 cards, players produce a resource (called "ink") that allows cards (representing characters, items, and song lyrics from Disney media) to be summoned. Turns are made up of a sequence of generating ink, playing cards, using actions from cards, and challenging opposing opponents' character cards. Players attempt to accrue twenty points before their opponent, while interacting with each other's cards.</p>

<h3>Card storage</h3>
<p>The ole' binder and binder-card pages may be your instinctive go-to, but use caution! The standard binder rings can result in an indentation in some cards due to pages sliding behind the rings before you close the binder. This can lead to a serious depreciation in value and just a bad overall look! If you're sticking with it, just make sure to clear all the pages from the rings' pressure. A step up from that is to choose a D-ring binder which has one side of the binding rings that has a straight edge which can prevent those pages from falling prey to those horrid indentations! There are also other specialized binders for storage.</p>
<p>You'll also want to invest in 'penny sleeves' and 'top-loaders'. These are added protection for individual cards. The penny sleeves are a thin, plastic sleeve for a single card. You can use these in addition to the binder pages or top-loaders. The top-loaders are a hard plastic cover that protects the cards from bending or scratching. These are better options than a zip lock bag and placing it in a book.</p>
