<h1 class="aligncenter">Beyond the Go-Bag</h1>
<p><small>Published 17 December 2023</small></p>
<p>Beyond the go-Bag.</p>
<p>In my initial podcast (not yet uploaded), I discussed #survivalism and ways to best prepare for a disaster, which was gathering supplies into a bag which you can quickly grab and go, otherwise known as a go-bag(1). However, while a disaster is more of a local, time-limited event, a go-bag is not designed for prolonged or widespread problems like that of a catastrophe--a large-scale event with complex, far-reaching consequences that persist over the long term and can result in societal infrastructure being damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>When circumstances such as the collapse of society occurs, densely populated areas can strain the local infrastructure. Access to medicine will be compromised within the first 24 hours, followed by government, law enforcement and transportation after 72. Communications, waste, water, and power may last approximately seven days.  After a series of cascading failures, most of the systems will experience a collapse by day 21.</p>
<p>Because of this, #preppers will tend to seek land in rural areas. If leaving isn't an option, you can extend your provisions within your own home by learning certain food preservation techniques (2) such as canning, as well as storing available water and ways to purify it.
<p>However, retreating to a patch of land away from urban and suburban areas presents the opportunity for individuals to segregate themselves from a potentially dangerous population as well as living #offthegrid(3), such as relying on agricultural techniques to produce food(4). Water purification will be a more vital process if you try to get it from water reservoirs. Another challenge will be learning hunting, trapping(5), and fishing if you are not experienced in these.</p>
<p>The following are recommended reading:</p>

<p>  (1)	The Prepper’s Medical Handbook by William W. Forgery, MD is an excellent source in preparing a go-bag with medical care in mind.</p>
<p>  (2)	A Guide to Freezing, Curing & Smoking Meat, Fish & Game by Wilbur F. Eastman Jr. is a reference for not only learning the titular methodologies, but also pickling methods.</p>
<p>  (3)	Prepper’s Long-Term Survival Guide by Jim Cobb discusses Food, Shelter, Security, Off-the-Grid Power as well as other self-sufficient living strategies.</p>
<p>  (4)	David Toht offers sustainable living options in 40 Projects for Building Your Backyard Homestead.</p>
<p>  (5)	The Bushcraft Field Guide to Trapping, Gathering, & Cooking in the Wild by David Canterbury can help readers identify what to eat, where to find it, and how to cook it.</p>
